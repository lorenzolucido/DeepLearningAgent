These files are to be used for the Berleley Pacman projects. 
The DeepLearningAgent class inherits from PacmanQAgent. The agent is intended to try to build its own features from experience using the Feature Learner.

** First version **
- Created a first version of the DeepLearningAgent based on the PacmanQAgent
- Implemented pre-processing 
- Implemented K-means for feature learning
- Implemented the Sparse Encoder (with options to use a Linear/Sigmoidal/Binary output and to "Auto-encode")
- Implemented a version of classic neural networks
